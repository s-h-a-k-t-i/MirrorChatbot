## The Task
You are required to build a SPA (Single page application) using any frontend framework (React JS preferred) which is a chat application.
Pages in the application :

### Chat Page
  - A chat page is a chat window where users can chat with the mirror chatbot (i.e. essentially a chatbot that sends back the user input).
  - An input field where the user can enter his message and a send button alongside to send the message.
  - A chat window where chat between user and chatbot is shown.
  - A header on top of the page with a chatbot image and name.
  - When a user sends a message in the chat view, the same message will be echoed back which will be shown as the response message from the mirror chatbot in the chat window.

### Note:
  - Create a beautiful responsive design that should work seamlessly on the web, tablet & mobile.
  - You can use any CSS framework.
  - Use any browser storage to store the chat history of the user so that when the user comes back to his chat it is resumed from the same place.
  - Save your code to a git repository and share the URL with us.

### Bonus:
  - Deploy the code on any hosting service and share the URL ( Netlify, Github pages, etc.)
  - Write unit test cases for your application.
